The video subject I was able to recieve the most helpful information from was the direct proofs one where he starts to explain something
I didn't really wrap my head around in class during lecture but being able to go to the video for some more clarifaction helped me. He was
able to break it down using simple definitions then began to explain it by using a simple proof of if x is odd, x^2 is odd.
He gave clear and definite breakdown and explained the way to solve this particular proof which helped explain to me the way to solve it 
and the proper thinking method I should use when solving other proofs just like this one. It basically taught me to try and prove it using 
the same basic odd is equalivalent to 2n+1 and solve from there which was easy since it only expects to use basic math in order to solve it
